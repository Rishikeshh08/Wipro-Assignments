            <p class="content">A paragraph is a distinct section of writing, typically consisting of several sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. It is organized around a central topic sentence, supported by body sentences with details and examples, and often concludes with a sentence that summarizes the point or transitions to the next paragraph. Paragraphs help structure and organize written work, making it easier for readers to follow the author's thoughts. </p>
